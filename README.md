Cuckoo Cycle is the first graph-theoretic proof-of-work,
and the most memory bound, yet with instant verification.

Proofs take the form of a length 42 cycle in a bipartite graph with N nodes and
N/2 edges, with N scalable from millions to billions and beyond.

This makes verification trivial: compute the 42x2 edge endpoints with one
initialising blake2b and 84 very cheap siphash-2-4 hashes, check that each
endpoint occurs twice, and that you come back to the starting point only after
traversing 42 edges (this also makes Cuckoo Cycle, unlike Hashcash, relatively
immune from Grover's quantum search algorithm).

A final blake2b hash on the sorted 42 nonces can check whether the 42-cycle
meets a difficulty target.

This is implemented in under 220 lines of C code (files src/{siphash.h,cuckoo.h,cuckoo.c}).

From this point of view, Cuckoo Cycle is a very simple PoW,
requiring hardly any code, time, or memory to verify.

Finding a 42-cycle, on the other hand, is far from trivial,
requiring considerable resources, and some luck
(for a given header, the odds of its graph having a L-cycle are about 1 in L).

The memory efficient miner uses 3 bits per edge and is bottlenecked by
accessing random 2-bit counters, making it memory latency bound.  The roughly
4x faster latency avoiding miner, a rewrite from xenoncat's bounty winning solver,
uses 33 bits per edge and is bottlenecked by bucket sorting. making it memory bandwidth bound.

ASICs
-----
Competitive single-chip mining ASICs have the following characteristics:
* They run hot and require extensive, noisy, cooling
* Their operational (electricity) costs exceed their capital costs
* They tend to get obsoleted by more efficient newer generations
* They require ordering long in advance of delivery
The need for big and risky investment raises the barrier to entry,
while the mining industries' thirst for cheap power leads to geographical centralization.
Cuckoo Cycle strongly resists single-chip ASICs due to its large memory requirements.

Memory ASICs
------------
DRAM can be viewed as an Integrated Circuit Customized to the Application of writing and reading words of memory
in mostly sequential fashion. It's perhaps the most cost optimized and commoditized ASICs in existence.
It uses only moderate power (on the order of 1W per chip) and is ubiquitous in the device landscape.
Every modern smart phone includes a few GBs of DRAM that mostly sits idle as it recharges overnight.
This present unique opportunities for a PoW that is minimally compute intensive and maximally memory intensive.

Cuckoo Cycle could be implemented as a tiny low-power ASIC that runs the bandwidth bound solver.
It wouldn't need to run at the highest possible levels of efficiency, just efficient enough to saturate
the limited DRAM bandwidth, which is going to be the bottleneck anyway.
In terms of solutions per Joule of energy, this should be least somewhat efficient,
and with most of the capital cost already sunk, offers a very attractive mining platform,
with huge scope for decentralization.

An indirectly useful Proof of Work
--------------
Although running the latency bound solver requires an order of magnitude less memory,
current low-latency memory ASICs such as RLDRAM3 and QDR-IV SRAM are over an order of magnitude more expensive.
Cuckoo Cycle provides strong incentives to making low-latency memory affordable enough to tip the scale,
benefitting many applications beyond mining.

Cycle finding
--------------
The algorithm implemented in lean_miner.hpp runs in time linear in N.
(Note that running in sub-linear time is out of the question, as you could
only compute a fraction of all edges, and the odds of all 42 edges of a cycle
occurring in this fraction are astronomically small).

Memory-wise, it uses N/2 bits to maintain a subset of all edges (potential
cycle edges) and N additional bits to trim the subset in a series of edge trimming rounds.
The bandwidth bound algorithm implemented in mean_miner.hpp instead uses 16N bits to maintains
lists of edges and less than N bits for trimming.
This is the phase that takes the vast majority of runtime.

Once the subset is small enough, an algorithm inspired by Cuckoo Hashing
is used to recognise all cycles, and recover those of the right length.

Performance
--------------

The runtime of a single proof attempt for a 2^30 node graph on a 4GHz i7-4790K is 10.5 seconds
with the single-threaded mean solver, using 2200MB (or 3200MB with faster solution recovery).
This reduces to 3.5 seconds with 4 threads (3x speedup).

Using an order of magnitude less memory (just under 200MB),
the lean solver takes 32.8 seconds per proof attempt.
Its multi-threading performance is less impressive though,
with 2 threads still taking 25.6 seconds and 4 taking 20.5 seconds.

I claim that these implementations are reasonably optimal,
secondly, that trading off (less) memory for (more) running time,
incurs at least one order of magnitude extra slowdown,
and finally, that mean_miner.cu is a reasonably optimal GPU miner.
The latter runs about 2.4x faster on an NVIDA 1080Ti than mean_miner on an Intel Core-i7 CPU.
To that end, I offer the following bounties:

CPU Speedup Bounties
--------------
$10000 for an open source implementation that finds 42-cycles twice as fast
as lean_miner, using no more than 1 byte per edge.

$10000 for an open source implementation that finds 42-cycles twice as fast
as mean_miner, regardless of memory use.

Linear Time-Memory Trade-Off Bounty
--------------
$10000 for an open source implementation that uses at most N/k bits while finding 42-cycles up to 10 k times slower, for any k>=2.

All of these bounties require N ranging over {2^28,2^30,2^32} and #threads
ranging over {1,2,4,8}, and further assume a high-end Intel Core i7 or Xeon and
recent gcc compiler with regular flags as in my Makefile.

GPU Speedup Bounty
--------------
$5000 for an open source implementation for a consumer GPU
that finds 42-cycles twice as fast as mean_miner.cu on 2^30 node graphs on comparable hardware.

The Makefile defines corresponding targets leancpubounty, meancpubounty, tmtobounty, and gpubounty.

Double and fractional bounties
------------------------
Improvements by a factor of 4 will be rewarded with double the regular bounty.

In order to minimize the risk of missing out on less drastic improvements,
I further offer a fraction FRAC of the regular CPU/GPU-speedup bounty, payable in bitcoin cash,
for improvements by a factor of 2^FRAC, where FRAC is at least one-tenth.
Note that 2^0.1 is about a 7% improvement.

Happy bounty hunting!
